# OpenAI Realtime WebRTC Integration

This project provides a seamless integration between **WebRTC** and the **OpenAI Realtime API**, allowing developers to build low-latency, multi-modal applications with text and audio interactions. It is built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript** for a robust, scalable, and developer-friendly experience.

## How OpenAI Realtime API Works with WebRTC

The OpenAI Realtime API provides robust support for real-time, multi-modal interactions using WebRTC and WebSockets. While the API supports both protocols, this project is specifically designed for client-side applications and focuses on leveraging WebRTC for seamless integration.

### How it Works with WebRTC:
- **Ephemeral Token Authentication**: The integration starts with obtaining an ephemeral token, a secure and temporary credential that is valid for 30 minutes. This token is fetched from a backend API endpoint, ensuring client-side security.
- **WebRTC Peer Connection**: A WebRTC peer connection is established between the client application and the OpenAI Realtime API. This enables:
    - **Audio Streaming**: Real-time microphone input is streamed to the API, and audio responses are played back on the client side.
    - **Data Channel Communication**: A data channel is used to exchange messages and events, such as sending text inputs, configuring session settings, and triggering responses.
- **Session Management and Dynamic Configuration**: Using the WebRTC data channel, the client can dynamically configure the session by sending predefined events. These include setting transcription options, choosing voice outputs, or adjusting model-specific settings.

### Why WebRTC?

WebRTC is particularly suited for client-side applications due to its ability to handle real-time media streams and dynamic network conditions. It provides lower latency and richer controls compared to WebSocket implementations, making it ideal for interactive and audio-driven applications.

### Key Features in this Project:
- Full WebRTC-based integration with the OpenAI Realtime API for low-latency audio and text interactions.
- Support for real-time session updates and dynamic model configurations using the WebRTC data channel.
- Focused on client-side simplicity, enabling seamless integration for frontend developers.
